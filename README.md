# Predictive Maintenance System for Equipment

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict equipment failures in tech companies that manage large networks of devices such as servers, routers, and IoT devices. The goal is to reduce downtime, save costs, and ensure better service through early failure detection.

## Solution

The predictive maintenance system utilizes Machine Learning tools to forecast device failures based on historical data. The primary techniques employed are:

- **Random Forests**
- **XGBoost**

These models analyze various metrics like temperature, voltage, and performance indicators to predict the likelihood of device failure.

## Data

- **Synthetic Data:** Used for model training and evaluation.
- **Real Data:** Can be substituted easily for real-world applications.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:** Generate and preprocess synthetic data.
2. **Model Training:** Implement and train Random Forest and XGBoost models.
3. **Prediction:** Forecast potential failures to proactively address issues.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Model:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
